motivation
Hey there! I’m Masiya Khumalo, a software developer who’s as curious as a cat and as passionate as a football fan during the World Cup. My tech journey is just kicking off, but boy, am I excited to see where this wild ride takes me! I’m currently diving into new programming languages like ReactJS, kind of like how one dives into a pizza after a long day. And when it comes to frameworks and libraries, I’m exploring them like an adventurer in a new city. Every challenge? That’s just another dragon to slay. Every setback? Just a plot twist in my tech adventure. And the future? Well, let’s just say I’m as excited as a kid in a candy store. So here’s to the journey, the late-night coding sessions, the “Eureka!” moments, and the joy of seeing my code come to life. The tech world better watch out, because here I come!
